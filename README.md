This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Enable authentication with Graphql Microservice

In order to test the authentication process on a local environment you should inform the _REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_ (both in _".env"_ and _".env.local"_ files) with the _client_id_ that you have previously generated at _https://console.developers.google.com/_ (keep in mind you have generated your own OAuth key with your personal email and not the company's since it's not allowed).

Also, for this process to work you need to enable the authentication configuration from the Graphql Microservice, just by:

* Informing the _client_id_ and _client_secret_ properties (located in _config.json_) that you've obtained from the Google developers console.
* Enabling the authentication property, by informing the property _security_aouth_enable = true_ (also in _config.json_)
* Start the service.
